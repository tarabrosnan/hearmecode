# Challenge Level: Beginner
# Background: You have a text file with all of the US state names:
#       states.txt: See section_07_(files).  
#       You also have a spreadsheet in comma separated value (CSV) format, state_info.csv.  See also section_07_(files)
#       state_info.csv has the following columns: Population Rank, State Name, Population, US House Members, Percent of US Population

# Challenge 1: Open states.txt and use the information to generate an HTML drop-down menu as in: https://github.com/shannonturner/python-lessons/blob/master/playtime/lesson02_states.py
# Challenge 2: Save the HTML as states.html instead of printing it to screen.  
# Your states.html should look identical (or at least similar) to the one you created in the Lesson 2 playtime, except you're getting the states from a file instead of a list.

# Challenge 3: Using state_info.csv, create an HTML page that has a table for *each* state with all of the state details.

# Sample output:

# <table border="1">
# <tr>
# <td colspan="2"> California </td>
# </tr>
# <tr>
# <td> Rank: 1 </td>
# <td> Percent: 11.91% </td>
# </tr>
# <tr>
# <td> US House Members: 53 </td>
# <td> Population: 38,332,521 </td>
# </tr>
# </table>

# Challenge 4 (Not a Python challenge, but an HTML/Javascript challenge): When you make a choice from the drop-down menu, jump to that state's table.
